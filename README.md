## Project Name
**Cheddar News Senior Software Developer**
**Insight and Analysis**

## Project Objective
**The Problem**
How can Cheddar News and RateMyProfessors effectively provide reliable teacher and class data in order to compete with rising competition such as Coursicle?

**The Solution**
Through this project, I will identify the areas where RateMyProfessors is limited by comparing it to PROWL data and provide recommendations for Cheddar News to improve the website. 

## Job Description
Cheddar News is an entertainment and news provider. In 2018, the company acquired RateMyProfessors, a website that students across the country utilize to gain information on professors they may want to take. As a Senior Software Developer at Cheddar News, the employee would be responsible for the building and growing RateMyProfessorâ€™s professor recommendation service. Essential skills for this role are expertise in MySQL, AWS, and data querying. By gathering data from both RateMyProfessors and PROWL, I will be able to provide recommendations to Cheddar News that will promote efficiency and increase page visits.

## Data
### Source
https://www.ratemyprofessors.com
Teacher data webscraped using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

https://bannerxe.lmu.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/term/termSelection?mode=search
Teacher and class data scraped from PROWL using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

### Characteristics
RMP data includes InstructorID, Instructor, Difficulty, Rating, CountRatings, WouldRetake

PROWL data includes Title, Subject Description, SubjectID, Subject, Course Number, Section, CRN, InstructorID, Instructor, MeetingDays, Campus, Instructional Methods

## Notebooks
### data_collection.ipynb
Contains all python code for webscraping and creating CSVs for both RateMyProfessors and PROWL. 

### [data_collection_prowl.ipynb](data_collection_prowl.ipynb)
Premerged file containing all python code for PROWL data collection.

### data_collection_RMP.ipynb
Premerged file containing all python code for RateMyProfessors data collection.

### data_manipulation.ipynb
Contains all python code used in cleaning the data and converting it to usable info. Specifically changing the format of certain fields. 

- Not mentioned is data cleaning done in Excel, where I created multiple tables used later on in SQL analysis

### sql_analysis.ipynb
Contains all python/MySQL code for running SQL Analysis and generating insight for both datasets.

### Merging_Files.ipynb
Python file used to merge sql_analysis.ipynb with data_collection.ipynb into presentation.ipynb

### presentation.ipynb
Combined python file formatted for presenting the methods, analysis, and recommendations generated.

## Future Improvements
If given more time, I would like to scale this up for every college. One limitation I currently have that I would want to research more is the legality of using real time teacher data. Coursicle has data that updates each semester and I would like to understand how they are able to do it so I could apply it to this project.
